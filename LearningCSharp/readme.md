# Learning C Sharp

### Technologies Used

- ASP.NET written in C#
- Bootstrap written in HTML & CSS

### The purpose

> First exposure to C# and the ASP.NET framework can be quite overwhelming. Therefore, my optimal learning approach for this is to:
1. Practically implement the code through trail and error
2. Explain the processes in writing or verbally straight after
