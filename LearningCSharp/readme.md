# Learning C Sharp

### Technologies Used

- ASP.NET written in C#
- Bootstrap written in HTML & CSS

### The purpose

> First exposure to C# and the ASP.NET framework can be quite overwhelming. Therefore, my optimal learning approach for this is to:
1. Practically implement the code through trial and error
2. Explain the processes in writing or verbally straight after

### Soon to implement
- [x] Create an MVC Model explaination page
- [x] Return POCO and Controller data to View
- [ ] Add a T-SQL database to store data
- [ ] Map the database to a model and pass data to the View
- [ ] Algorithm to display the database data onto View page
- [ ] Improve design astetic of returned data to View
